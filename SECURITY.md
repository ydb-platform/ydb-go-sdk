# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities they discovered in YDB. All reports are thoroughly investigated.

To report a potential vulnerability in YDB please email details to [security@ydb.tech](mailto:security@ydb.tech).

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in YDB
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects YDB

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by YDB maintainers within 5 working days.
We will keep the reporter informed about the issue progress.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by YDB maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a mitigation is available for YDB users. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to 90 days. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
