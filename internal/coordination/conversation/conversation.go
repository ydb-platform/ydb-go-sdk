// Controller provides a simple mechanism to work with a session protocol using a gRPC bidirectional stream. Creating a
// bidirectional stream client may be quite tricky because messages are usually being processed independently and in
// parallel. Moreover, the gRPC client library puts strict limitations on an implementation of the client, e.g. multiple
// calls of the Send or Recv methods of the stub client must not be performed from different goroutines. Also, there are
// no guarantees that a message successfully dispatched by the Send method will actually reach the server, neither does
// the server enjoy same guarantees when delivering messages to the client. This usually ends up having two goroutines
// (one for sending outgoing messages and another one for receiving incoming ones) and a queue where messages are
// published to be eventually delivered to the server. The Controller simplifies working with this model providing
// generic implementation of the message queue and related routines, handling retries of sent and pending operations
// when the underlying gRPC stream needs to be reconnected.
//
// A typical coordination session looks like this (we are going to skip for now how the gRPC stream is created, handled
// and kept alive, you can find the details on that in the Session, and focus on the protocol):
//
//  1. The client opens a new gRPC bidirectional stream.
//  2. The client sends the SessionStart request and wait until the Failure or the SessionStarted reply.
//  3. The server sends the SessionStarted response with the SessionID. At this point the session is started. If the
//     client needs to reconnect the gRPC stream in the future, it will use that SessionID to attach to the previously
//     created session in the SessionStart request.
//  4. The client sends the AcquireSemaphore request to acquire a permit to the semaphore in this session with count 5.
//  5. After a moment, the client decides to acquire another semaphore, it sends one more AcquireSemaphore request with
//     count 4.
//  6. The server replies with the AcquireSemaphoreResult response to the second AcquireSemaphore request to inform the
//     client that the semaphore was successfully acquired.
//  7. The server replies with the AcquireSemaphorePending response in order to inform the client that the semaphore
//     from the first request has been acquired by another session.
//  8. After a while, the server sends the AcquireSemaphoreResult response which implies that the semaphore from the
//     first request is acquired in the current session.
//  9. Then the client sends the ReleaseSemaphore request in order to release the acquired semaphore.
//  10. The server replies with the ReleaseSemaphoreResult.
//  11. The client terminates the session with the SessionStop request.
//  12. The server let the client know that the session is over sending the SessionStopped response and closing the gRPC
//     stream.
//
// We can notice five independent conversations here:
//
// 1. StartSession, SessionStarted — points 2–3;
// 2. AcquireSemaphore, AcquireSemaphoreResult — points 4, 6;
// 3. AcquireSemaphore, AcquireSemaphorePending, AcquireSemaphoreResult — points 5, 7 and 8;
// 4. ReleaseSemaphore, ReleaseSemaphoreResult — points 9–10;
// 5. SessionStop, SessionStopped — points 11–12.
//
// If at any time the client encounters an unrecoverable error (for example, the underlying gRPC stream becomes
// disconnected), the client will have to replay every conversation from their very beginning. Let us see why it is
// actually the case. But before we go into that, let us look at the grpc.ClientStream SendMsg method:
//
// "…SendMsg does not wait until the message is received by the server. An untimely stream closure may result in lost
// messages. To ensure delivery, users should ensure the RPC completed successfully using RecvMsg…"
//
// This is true for both, the client and the server. So when the server replies to the client it does not really know if
// the response is received by the client. And vice versa, when the client sends a request to the server it has no way
// to know if the request was delivered to the server unless the server sends another message to the client in reply.
//
// That is why conversation-like protocols typically use idempotent requests. Idempotent requests can be safely retried
// as long as you keep the original order of the conversations. For example, if the gRPC stream is terminated before
// the point 6, we cannot know if the server gets the requests. There may be one, two or none AcquireSemaphore requests
// successfully delivered to and handled by the server. Moreover, the server may have already sent to the client the
// corresponding responses. Nevertheless, if the requests are idempotent, we can safely retry them all in the newly
// created gRPC stream and get the same results as we would have got if we had sent them without stream termination.
// Note that if the stream is terminated before the point 8, we still need to replay the first AcquireSemaphore
// conversation because we have no knowledge if the server replied with the AcquireSemaphoreResult in the terminated
// stream.
//
// However, sometimes even idempotent requests cannot be safely retried. Consider the case wherein the point 5 from the
// original list is:
//
//  5. After a moment, the client decides to modify the AcquireSemaphore request and sends another one with the same
//     semaphore but with count 4.
//
// If then the gRPC stream terminates, there are two likely outcomes:
//
//  1. The server received the first request but the second one was not delivered. The current semaphore count is 5.
//  2. The server received and processed the both requests. The current semaphore permit count is 4.
//
// If we retry the both requests, the observed result will be different depending on which outcome occurs:
//
//  1. The first retry will be a noop, the second one will decrease the semaphore count to 4. This is expected behavior.
//  2. The first retry will try to increase the semaphore count to 5, it causes an error. This is unexpected.
//
// In order to avoid that we could postpone a conversation if there is another one for the same semaphore which has been
// sent but has not been yet delivered to the server. For more details, see the WithConflictKey option.
